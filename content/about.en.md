### Kotet

![Kotet](/img/common/logo.png)

No official pronunciation of "Kotet".
You can pronounce as you like.

I drawn the image above few years ago.
I am not good at drawing, and this is my best painting.
I can't draw an image with same quality, forever.

I often write programs using **D programming language**.
But because of I'm a beginner, I still can't system programming.
